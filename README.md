# Nu-Money
NuMoney is our attempt at recreating a Money Transfer as a Service (MTaaS) app. 

Collab team: CaptGillespie ** AndrewJJT ** hssol

Summary:
Our project will be a web app built in C# where the goal is to create a basic money transfer
system where a user could buy Bits from our app, send Bits to other users, and even cash out
their Bits to their PayPal balance. The major focus on this project is learning to utilize APIâ€™s like
3rd Party Authentications and using PayPal as a payment method and understanding app
security.

Features:
P0- All features working (except cash out and circle features), 3rd party auth API, and a paypal checkout API
feature to add currency to the app
P1- Add more dynamic viewing features to the front end, get the cash out/circle features working
P2- Find a way to make money off the transactions (Ad revenue shared with user for viewing ads?)

Technical Considerations:
We built our project around Visual Studio, which is a relatively new technology for all of us. It
seemed like the best option for us to integrate the features and security we want within our app.
Language is C#. We are also utilizing Microsoft Azure Cloud Services to host a SQL
database/server from the cloud.
Work Distribution:
For our workflow we will use Github. Since the Front end on this app will be pretty robust, Sean
will focus solely on it. For the Back end and Database, AndrewJJT and hssol will work together
to join forces with the Front end side. This includes utilizing API calls (paypal, 3rd party auth).
